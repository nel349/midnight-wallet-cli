# Changelog

All notable changes to midnight-wallet-cli will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Instant dust recovery after transaction rejection** — Rejecting a `submitTransaction` in `mn serve` no longer breaks the dust wallet. Previously, the SDK's internal revert mechanism (`CoreWallet.applyFailed`) called `processTtls()` which destroyed the dust UTXO entirely, leaving the wallet unable to balance any further write operations until new dust was generated on-chain (2+ minutes on preprod, requiring a cache clear and restart in the worst case). We now snapshot the WASM `DustLocalState` before each dust spend and restore it on revert, giving the coin back instantly. Operators can reject and re-approve transactions as many times as needed without any interruption.
- **Cache corruption on Ctrl+C** — Shutting down `mn serve` while a transaction was pending (balanced but not yet submitted) would serialize the dust wallet's corrupted state to the cache file, causing subsequent commands like `mn dust status` to report zero dust. The shutdown path now skips the cache save when transactions are still in-flight, preserving the last known-good cache.
- **Abandoned transaction cleanup** — Pending transactions that are never submitted (DApp disconnects or goes silent) are now automatically reverted after 2 minutes, releasing locked dust coins back to available.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- **Multi-wallet support** — Named wallet management via `mn wallet generate|list|use|info|remove`. Wallets stored as `~/.midnight/wallets/<name>.json` with active wallet tracked in config. The `--wallet` flag accepts a wallet name (e.g. `--wallet alice`) in addition to file paths. Old `~/.midnight/wallet.json` auto-migrates to `wallets/default.json` on first run. `mn generate` is deprecated in favor of `mn wallet generate <name>`.
- **Preprod network support** — Connect to the Midnight pre-production testnet with `--network preprod`. Includes built-in endpoint URLs for indexer, node, and proof server.
- **Endpoint override flags** — `--proof-server`, `--node`, `--indexer-ws` flags on transaction commands. Persist overrides with `mn config set proof-server <url>`. Priority: flag > config > network default.
- **Wallet state cache** — Persistent cache of serialized wallet state. Subsequent runs restore from checkpoint and only sync new transactions. Reduces repeat sync from 1–5 min to 5–30 seconds. Use `--no-cache` to bypass.
- **Wallet name validation** — Shared `isValidWalletName()` validator rejects path traversal, `.json` suffix, control characters, and other unsafe names across all wallet operations.
- **Testcontainer auto-detection** — On `undeployed` network, automatically detects Docker-mapped ports for node, indexer, and proof server.

### Improved

- **DApp Connector Server (`mn serve`)**
  - Connection IDs (`conn_1`, `conn_2`) in approval prompts and logs
  - Transaction payload size shown in approval prompts
  - Per-connection request counter for log correlation
  - Response timing in server log (e.g. `← submitTransaction (2.3s)`)
  - Transaction hash logged after successful submit
  - Combined balance + submit approval — prep steps auto-approved, only the final `submitTransaction` prompts
