# Lessons Learned

## CLAUDE.md Structure
- CLAUDE.md should focus on workflow, process, and principles — not be a technical spec dump
- Technical details (SDK patterns, network configs, constants, file structure) belong in DESIGN.md
- Keep CLAUDE.md concise: workflow orchestration, task management, core principles, tech stack constraints
